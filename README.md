# Overview
This is a Fork of atestouch by @AtesQuik

And it is fully documented, blazingly fast, easy to use and work in progress touch controls library for all GameMaker games!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a Fork of atestouch V1, so this will not have the functionality of later versions that may or may not be made
>
> also this repo was made for archival purposes, so updates are probably not gonna happen

# Current Functionality of V1
- V1: Function to create touch elements, editing mode to modify the buttons, saving and loading
- Very easily integrable, just by applying the .yymps to your GameMaker project.
- Customization, thanks to the included edit mode.
- Very fast, it works as well as virtual keys although it doesn't use them.

# Documentation
- You can refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/AtesQuik/atestouch/wiki) once its done.

# Thanks to
- @AtesQuik, for atestouch (duh)
- her sister, for the sprites :)

# LICENSE
- atestouch is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information.
- TLDR; You're free to use this as long as proper credit is given, if the ports are made without the consent of the author of the game or something controversial, I have a right to ask you to remove **atestouch** content from your project.
- The sprites used in this project were made by my sister, huge thanks to her :> (You can use them with proper credit.)
